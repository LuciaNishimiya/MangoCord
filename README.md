## Features

AkarinProxy being a fork of Waterfall, has all its features, and some of its own, such as:

* **Exploit Fixes**: AkarinProxy specializes in providing better server security by fixing major exploits, performance flaws and bugs that Bungeecord already has, and that have not yet been fixed in WaterfallMC.
  
* **Antibot Features**: FlameCord brings swift bot protection for your Minecraft server to avoid extra CPU usage and crashes in your machines.

* **Performance Improvements**: AkarinProxytries to improve performance by removing unused features and disabling exception logs.

## Why fork Waterfall?

AkarinProxy was forked out of a desire for greater protection to be afforded to a Bungeecord-based proxy, which Waterfall currently cannot offer.

AkarinProxy will track upstream Waterfall and merge changes as needed.
